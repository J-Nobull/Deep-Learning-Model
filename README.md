Objective: Build multiple predictive models to analyze and forecast song popularity based on its characteristics.

Train a model using one of the Machine Learning techniques (such as k-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees) and check the modelâ€™s performance. 
Create and train a second model using Deep Learning Neural Networks to see how the model accuracy changes.

Using song characteristics to Predict Song Popularity
H0 (Null Hypothesis): Audio features (danceability, energy, tempo, etc.) do not significantly impact a song's popularity.
